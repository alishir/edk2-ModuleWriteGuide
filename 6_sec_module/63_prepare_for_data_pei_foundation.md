## 6.3 Prepare for Data PEI Foundation

Upon completion, SEC will call the PEI Foundation entry point and transfer
control to it.

The PEI foundation Entry Point is defined as,

```c
typedef

VOID

EFIAPI

(*EFI_PEI_CORE_ENTRY_POINT)(

IN CONST EFI_SEC_PEI_HAND_OFF *SecCoreData,

IN CONST EFI_PEI_PPI_DESCRIPTOR *PpiList );
```
### 6.3.1 EFI_SEC_PEI_HAND_OFF * SecCoreData

SEC conveys the following handoff information to the PEI Foundation, ï‚· State of
the platform.

* Location and size of the Boot Firmware Volume (BFV).

* Location and size of the temporary RAM.

* Location and size of the stack.

The format is defined as the `EFI_SEC_PEI_HAND_OFF` structure.

An example of, the temporary memory layout from Nt32Pkg is shown below:

```
|-----------| <---- TemporaryRamBase + TemporaryRamSize 
|   Heap    | 
|           | 
|-----------| <---- StackBase / PeiTemporaryMemoryBase 
|           | 
|   Stack   | 
|-----------| <---- TemporaryRamBase
```

###### Figure 3 Temporary Memory Layout

The `EFI_SEC_PEI_HAND_OFF` data structure is populated as follows:

```c
SecCoreData->DataSize = sizeof (EFI_SEC_PEI_HAND_OFF);
SecCoreData->BootFirmwareVolumeBase = (VOID *)BootFirmwareVolumeBase;
SecCoreData->BootFirmwareVolumeSize = PcdWinNtFirmwareFdSize;
SecCoreData->TemporaryRamBase = (VOID *)(UINTN)LargestRegion;
SecCoreData->TemporaryRamSize = STACK_SIZE;
SecCoreData->StackBase = SecCoreData->TemporaryRamBase;
SecCoreData->StackSize = PeiStackSize;
SecCoreData->PeiTemporaryRamBase = (VOID *)((UINTN)
                                   SecCoreData->TemporaryRamBase + PeiStackSize);
SecCoreData->PeiTemporaryRamSize = STACK_SIZE - PeiStackSize;
```

### 6.3.2 EFI_PEI_PPI_DESCRIPTOR *PpiList

Besides the `EFI_SEC_PEI_HAND_OFF` data structure, SEC may transfer one
additional `PpiList` to the PEIM Foundation. For example, `PpiList` may include
`TEMPORARY_RAM_SUPPORT_PPI` and `SEC_PLATFORM_INFORMAITON_PPI`.

* `TEMPORARY_RAM_SUPPORT_PPI`

This service may be published by the SEC as part of the SEC-to-PEI handoff. If
so, it moves the Temporary RAM contents into Permanent RAM.

* `SEC_PLATFORM_INFORMAITON_PPI`

This service abstracts platform-specific information. It is necessary to convey
this information to the PEI Foundation so that it can locate the PEIM dispatch
order. In addition, it contains the maximum stack capabilities of this platform.
