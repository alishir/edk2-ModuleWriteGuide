# 4 UEFI Applications

UEFI Application is an EFI image of the type

EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_APPLICATION. This image is executed and automatically
unloaded when the image exits or returns from its entry point.

OS loader is a special type of application that normally does not return or
exit. Instead, it calls the EFI Boot Service gBS->ExitBootServices() to
transfer control of the platform from the firmware to an operating system.

The EFI Shell is a special EFI application that provides the user with a
command-line interface.
