EDK II provides all Pei Services APIs in the Pei Services Library class.
Developers can use the Pei Services Library directly to invoke PEI services.

EDK II provides PEI Services Table Library to obtain the pointer of the Pei
Service Table for PEIMs. Aside from obtaining the PEI Services Table pointer
from an input parameter in the PEIM entry point, EDK II also allows using the

`GetPeiServicesTablePointer()` defined in Pei Service Table Pointer Library.
