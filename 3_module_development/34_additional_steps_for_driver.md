## 3.4 Additional Steps for Driver

### 3.4.1 Define a Driver Entry Point

PEIM or DXE drivers expose the entry point function, which is defined in the
INF file [Defines] section as follows:

```ini
[Defines]
  ......
  ENTRY_POINT = PcdDxeInit
```

The prototype of the module entry point function differs according to module
type.

See Table 7 for details.
